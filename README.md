python script to grab videos from bumpworthy


far from perfect, grabs excess videos and some videos "wont work" due to site redirects :/
might fix later. if the "vids" are under ~100KB its actually a webpage and can be deleted.


edit the config file. try to avoid spaces in the paths. i can't say it'll work if they are there.

you might also need to edit the script. as of writing this, there's just under 9000 vids. you'll need
to update that at some point.

python script to grab videos from bumpworthy


far from perfect, grabs excess videos and some videos "wont work" due to site redirects :/
might fix later. if the "vids" are under ~100KB its actually a webpage and can be deleted.


edit the config file. try to avoid spaces in the paths. i can't say it'll work it they are there.
